Customers' information gathered from social media is the main data set used in this report. This dataset provides a detailed description of whether the client has purchased an item from the advertising company displayed on social media. Every consumer who bought a commodity is assigned the category of 1, while the others are given the number 0. Their age and salary are independent variables.
This experiment exhibits the application of Decision trees and Logistic regression and compares the outcomes to assess the efficacy of both models

The Second Experiemnt deals with Pulsar and non-pulsar dataset:
The objective is to create a model that can predict pulsar stars and non-pulsar stars. Candidates are now automatically labeled therefore supervised learning algorithms to classify elements based on their features are used. When examining data, aggregation and visualization draw attention to any outliers and biases. Data munging and pre-processing are used to get the data ready for machine learning models after understanding the original dataset. The significance of the data for the prediction will be weighed in the classifier columns. The target class column is the prediction of the outcomes of the pulsar star and non-pulsar star. The binary 0 or 1 result data in the target class field. A value of 0 indicates that it is “non-pulsar star” and 1 is “ pulsar star.”
Type 1 and Type 2 errors: Type 1 errors are referred to as false positives. This implies that the non-pulsar stars are projected to be pulsar stars, while Type 2 errors are known as false negatives, pulsar stars are predicted as 0 (non-pulsar). The dataset contains less than 2000 classes of pulsar stars and 16000 classes of non-pulsar stars. (figure 1). Most of the dataset has been categorized as 0. A classification model can easily predict non-pulsar stars while predicting pulsar stars is challenging. Thus, the model’s performance is evaluated on basis of reduced error in false negative.
