Customers' information gathered from social media is the main data set used in this report. This dataset provides a detailed description of whether the client has purchased an item from the advertising company displayed on social media. Every consumer who bought a commodity is assigned the category of 1, while the others are given the number 0. Their age and salary are independent variables.
This experiment exhibits the application of Decision trees and Logistic regression and compares the outcomes to assess the efficacy of both models.
